# Variables

The idea of defining a good name to our variables is to understand its functionality. The variables have to express and mean what it is its functionality. We have to be careful with these names.

# Scope

- Global scope: Any variables which is not into a function, will be into the global scope. So you can access them wherever you want.

- Local scope: Any variables which is into a function, will be into the local scope. So you can only access them into this function.


# Hoisting

Variables con `var` and functions `function` move up when it is declared, so you can use it wherever you want even if the function is in the end of the file. See `hoisting.js`
